# Robot Arm

This repository is for documenting my progress towards creating a robotic arm that can pick up objects and place them precisely in bins.  I am doing this largely for the [science olympiad event](https://www.soinc.org/robot_arm_c) that requires this.

I failed massively at building one for the 2016 science olympiad, so I hope I can rectify that by building an awesome one for next year!

## Compiling

If you are on a linux system, chances are that g++, part of the [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/) is already installed.  Just do the following in a shell:
`[user]$ g++ -o run.exe main.cpp`
